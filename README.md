## Steps to Contribute:
### Setting Up the Local Repository
This requires creating a fork. To do so: 
1. Create a fork of this repository by clicking on the `Fork` button on the repository homepage. <br />

2. Once the fork is created, clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-fork-name>.git
```
3. Enter the folder on your local machine using:
```
cd <your-fork-name>
```
4. Install required node packages(you should have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) set up on your local machine):
```
npm i
```
5. Run the server, then most changes will automatically be applied upon saving any file:
```
npm run dev
```
This will also tell you what is the URL of your local server.

### Steps to Push your code to the main repository:
1. Make the necessary changes, then commit and push using:
```
git add <required-files>
git commit -m "A descriptive commit message, preferably conventional format"
git push
```
2. Once you have verified the changes, open a pull request. The option will be visible on the fork homepage. Make sure to add a PR to the correct branch
3. The PR will be reviewed and accepted by admins
